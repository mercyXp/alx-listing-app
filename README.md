# ALX Listing App 

## 📌 About the Project

The **ALX Listing App** project aims to scaffold and lay the foundational structure for a modern **Airbnb clone**. This initial milestone focuses on setting up a well-organized and scalable codebase using:

- **Next.js**
- **TypeScript**
- **TailwindCSS**
- **ESLint**

By establishing a clean folder structure, reusable components, and adhering to best practices, the project provides a solid starting point for building a **dynamic, responsive, and user-friendly property listing page**.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

This milestone is designed for professional developers to strengthen their expertise in modern web application development. By completing it, learners will:

- 🚀 Gain hands-on experience scaffolding a Next.js project tailored for production readiness.
- 🧠 Implement TypeScript for type safety and reusable interfaces to enhance code maintainability and robustness.
- 🎨 Configure TailwindCSS for building responsive, accessible, and visually appealing UI components.
- 🏗️ Structure a Next.js project following industry-standard best practices for scalability and readability.
- 🧩 Create foundational reusable components and organize assets effectively for real-world applications.

---

## ✅ Requirements

### Prerequisites

To complete this milestone, you should have:

- Basic knowledge of **Next.js**, **React**, and **TypeScript**
- Familiarity with **TailwindCSS** and modern styling techniques
- Understanding of **ESLint** and how it maintains code quality
- Proficiency in organizing and structuring scalable projects

### Technical Requirements

- **Next.js** version **13+**
- **Node.js** version **16+** installed locally
- A text editor like **VS Code** with **TypeScript** and **TailwindCSS** extensions

---

## 🧱 Key Highlights

### 1. Project Setup

- Scaffold a new Next.js application named:

```

alx-listing-app

```

- Enable:
- TypeScript
- ESLint
- TailwindCSS

- Configure Tailwind with a **minimal and clean** setup using:
- `tailwind.config.js`
- `globals.css`

---

### 2. Folder Structure and Reusability

Establish a clean and scalable folder structure:

```

/components
/interfaces
/constants
/public/assets

```

- Create reusable components like:
  - `Card`
  - `Button`

This promotes modularity and scalability.

---

### 3. TypeScript Integration

- Define reusable interfaces such as `CardProps`, `ButtonProps`, etc.
- Place them in:

```

interfaces/index.ts

```

This ensures type safety and code consistency across the app.

---

### 4. Asset Management

- Organize images, icons, and SVGs under:

```

public/assets/

````

This ensures clean and centralized access for all assets.

---

## 🎨 From Figma Mockup

You will build and style components based on a provided **Figma design** (not included in this doc).

---

## 📄 Documentation and Run Instructions

- Create a comprehensive `README.md` file including:
- Project overview
- Goals
- Folder structure
- Technologies used
- Steps to run the project locally

- Run and verify your setup:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
````

* Ensure the application compiles and loads successfully at `http://localhost:3000`.

---

> ✅ By completing this milestone, you’ll have built the foundation for a fully scalable and production-ready property listing application.
